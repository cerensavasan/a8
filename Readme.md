I use three kinds of templates:
- The student profiles and breakdown of their grades
- Grade possibilities and the average grade for each
- Announcements

The technically challenging aspects of my assignment were:
- Using images in templates, seems to be problematic when using http servers so I used express to fix this problem.
- Gathering the grades of students, declared as strings, converting them to integers and calculating the average of each quiz and assignment.
- Layout was difficult to get right, as I have a lot of floating or inline-blocked elements.
